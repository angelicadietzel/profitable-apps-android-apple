There are not as many apps designed for fun compared to the number of apps designed for practical purposes (family, tools, business, lifestyle, productivity, etc.). However, if we investigate this further, we can see that the family category (which accounts for almost 19% of the apps) means mostly games for kids."

This application will focus on user's engagement as its main source of revenues by displaying in-app advertisements and this application will also be free and for English-speaking users. \n",

Since both markets are already full of libraries, we need to add special features other than the raw version of the book. A few ideas include: daily quotes, audio version of the book, quizzes, a forum where fans can discuss the book, gifs, etc. By doing so, we can increase time spent by users using the apps, which will also increase our revenue."
